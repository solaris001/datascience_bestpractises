## Introduction 

Recently data science practises were discussed in a broad social discourse, regarding biases within the data. In Psychology many theories are based on experimental data, therefore psychology student learn early in their statistics and diagnostics classes that data has many layers and in order to use it for a further interpretation, one has to be very careful in their data science practise in order to achieve validity and reliability. 

This is work tries to answer some of the concerns around statistics and data science. It is inspired by exercises that were coded as sample solutions for the class 'human-centered data science' at Freie Universität Berlin during the summer semester 2022. The teacher of the seminar was Lars Sipos, while the professor of the connected lecture ist Prof. Claudia Müller-Birn. From these exercises the project will continue and explore best data sciences practises for any interested person to follow. 

You can get started with the project, by installing Jupyter Notebook and Python in a virtual environment on your computer. Then you can clone the repository in the directory

Currently I am the only buting to this project. Feel free to reach out for help or other interests: vonhirschhausen@campus.tu-berlin.de 

Have fun and inisights working with the code!


## Structure of the Repository
[WarmUp](https://github.com/solaris001/datascience_bestpractises/tree/main/WarmUP) - Tutorial by Dr. Christoph Kinkeldey and Tim Korjakow, where basic data sciences concepts are introduced.

[Data](https://github.com/solaris001/datascience_bestpractises/tree/main/Data) - Coded by Laura vHirschhausen, where some data analysis is done: *univariate and bivariate exploratory analysis* and *multivariate statistics*

[Reproducibility](https://github.com/solaris001/datascience_bestpractises/tree/main/Reproducibility) - Coded by Laura vHirschhausen, trying to reproduce results from a scientific paper performing some *Logistic Regression*-, *Support Vector Machine*-, *naive Bayes*- and *Random Forest*-modelling.
