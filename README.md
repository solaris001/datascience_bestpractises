## Introduction 

This is work that was coded as sample solution for the class 'human-centered data science' at Freie Universität Berlin during the summer semester 2022. The teacher of the seminar was Lars Sipos, while the professor of the connected lecture ist Prof. Claudia Müller-Birn. 

The first exercise (Warm Up) follows a tutorial from Dr. Christoph Kinkeldey and Tim Korjakow, where basic data sciences concepts are introduced. The second exercise (data) and the third exercise (Reproducibility) are coded by me, Laura vHirschhausen. In the Data directory a first data analyses (*univariate and bivariate exploratory analysis* and *multivariate statistics*) is executed, followed by the third exercise where some *Logistic Regression*-, *Support Vector Machine*-, *naive Bayes*- and *Random Forest*-modelling is done.
