## Introduction 

In data science the why and how, like in many science is an important aspect of the analysis. Therefore we will explore some introductory data sciences practises in this codesheet that focus not only on the techncial analysis itself, but also tries to answer questions such as: Why do we chose the data model, we chose? What do we want to find out with our data sciences practise, and why?

This is, because it has been shown that as data scientist the domain knowledge, or more philosophically stated: the knowledge about the world and how the things in the world are and behave together, is as important as technical skills such as computer science and statistics, as nicely shown on this [graphic]() (Taken from an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-data-science-and-what-does-a-data-scientist-need-to-know-e20ead10aa3a) on data science pratice). 

Some interesting observation are done throughout this exercise, which show the importance on why to follow a careful handling of data, data analysis and data interpretation. 

What are those observations? :) IF you want to discuss them, feel free to contact me at: vonhirschhausen@campus.tu-berlin.de
