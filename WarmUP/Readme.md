## Introduction 

Sometimes when we start a new project, we also have to get familiar with some programming language and some basic functions again. 

In this tutorial, prepared by Dr. Christoph Kinkeldey and Tim Korjakow, we will get some python skills and data skills warmed up again. We'll learn how to use packages, how to load in different ways and edit datasets, how to work with different data formats and how to plot some data.
